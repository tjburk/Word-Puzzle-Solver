# Word-Puzzle-Solver
Project in C++ that takes 2 text files:

1. A dictionary of words to look for
2. A group of characters arranged in a grid pattern

The program will find words facing forwards, backwards, up, down, and any direction diagonally.
The program uses a hash table to optimize the amount of time it takes to find the words.
